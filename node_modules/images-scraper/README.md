# images-scraper

This a simple way to scrape Google images using Puppeteer. The headless browser will behave as a 'normal' user and scrolls to the bottom of the page until there are enough results.

**Please note that this is not an ideal approach to scrape images. It is only a demonstration to scrape images from Google.
If you don't care about the source, it is probably better to use a different search engine with an API, such as Bing.**

# Installation

`npm install images-scraper`

# Example

Give me the first 200 images of Banana's from Google (using headless browser)

```js
var Scraper = require('images-scraper');

const google = new Scraper({
  puppeteer: {
    headless: false,
  },
});

(async () => {
  const results = await google.scrape('banana', 200);
  console.log('results', results);
})();
```

## Results

`node src/example.js`

```js
results [
  {
    url: 'https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gettyimages-459761948.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C74px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip',
    source: 'https://time.com/5730790/banana-panama-disease/',
    title: 'What We Can Learn From the Near-Extinction of Bananas | Time'
  },
  ...
]
```

# Options

There are multiple options that can be passed to the constructor.

```js
var options = {
  userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0', // the user agent
  puppeteer: {}, // puppeteer options, for example, { headless: false }
  tbs: {  // every possible tbs search option, some examples and more info: http://jwebnet.net/advancedgooglesearch.html
    isz:  // options: l(arge), m(edium), i(cons), etc.
    itp:  // options: clipart, face, lineart, news, photo
    ic:   // options: color, gray, trans
    sur:  // options: fmc (commercial reuse with modification), fc (commercial reuse), fm (noncommercial reuse with modification), f (noncommercial reuse)
  },
  safe: false   // enable/disable safe search
};
```

# Repl.it

Example to fork: https://repl.it/join/hylyxvxc-peterevers

Running this on Repl.it requires you to create a Bash repl instead of a NodeJS repl. Creating a Bash repl will provide you the Chromium dependency.

# Heroku

To use this packages on Heroku, install https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack .
Then run.

```
npm config set puppeteer_download_host=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors
```

And reinstall Puppeteer.

# Debugging

Debugging can be done by disabling the headless browser and visually inspect the actions taken.

```js
const google = new Scraper({
  puppeteer: {
    headless: false,
  },
});
```

Or by settings the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL`.

`LOG_LEVEL=debug node src/example.js`.
